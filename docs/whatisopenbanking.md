# What is Open Banking?

## Understanding the ecosystem

In order to understand Open Banking, we'll need to define some terms and what the eco-system looks like.

## Third Party Providers (TPPs)

A third party provider within the context of Open Banking is a service that leverages open banking data to provide a payment or account access based service.

## Banks (ASPSPs)

In laymens terms, these are Banks. But for Open Banking's purposes these are referred to as ASPSPs. Not all ASPSPs are required to open up their data yet, but many choose to do so, such as [Monzo](https://docs.monzo.com/#accounts) and [Starling](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs)
