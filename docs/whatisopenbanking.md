# What is Open Banking?

Open Banking is reform of the financial sector. Specifially with regards to your financial information. Open Banking was initiated by the CMA (Comptetion & Markets Authority) alongside a new regulation called 'the second Payment Services Directive' (PSD2).

This means most UK banks will let you share (with your permission) your financial data such as your transaction data. This enables services like [Yolt](https://www.yolt.com/). The thought process is that opening up this data will bring more competition to the market. 

Currently Open Banking is mandated for the CMA9 which includes: 
* Barclays
* HSBC
* Lloyds
* Nationwide
* Danske Bank
* RBS
* Santander
* Bank of Ireland
* Allied Irish Bank

## How will this financial data be made available?

Data will be made available by through API's (Application Programming Interfaces). As a consumer, you would grant access to a third party to allow access to data you permit. This then allows the third party to act on your behalf to fetch data or even make payments.

## Who is involved in Open Banking?

To dive deeper into Open Banking we have to understand the different stakeholders and their interest within the ecosystem. 

### Third Party Providers (TPPs)

A third party provider within the context of Open Banking is a service that leverages open banking data to provide a payment or account access based service.

This is typically a small business or startup that wants to use your data as part of their business model. 

### Banks (ASPSPs)

In Open Banking land, banks are referred to as ASPSPs.

In laymens terms, these are Banks. 

But for Open Banking's purposes these are referred to as ASPSPs. Not all ASPSPs are required to open up their data yet, but many choose to do so, such as [Monzo](https://docs.monzo.com/#accounts) and [Starling](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs).
