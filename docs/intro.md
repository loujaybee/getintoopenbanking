Open Banking is a unique and growing industry, so there's lots going on.

But, despite it's name, Open Banking as an industry is chocked full of jargon, technical terms.

As a result, it isn't very, well ... open.

But, we're here to change that...

Get Into Open Banking is a project designed to help as many people as possible get into Open Banking.

We do this by providing simple to understand tutorials, resources and articles all collected together under one roof.

No more scouring the internet for answers to your questions about Open Banking and scratching your head wondering what the difference is between a: TPP, AISP, ASPSP, QTSP etc.
